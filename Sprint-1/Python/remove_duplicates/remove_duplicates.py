    Remove duplicate values from a sequence, preserving the order of the first occurrence of each value.

    Time complexity:
        ANSWER: O(n)
        Because the sequence is looped through once.

    Space complexity:
        ANSWER: O(n)
        Because a set is used to track seen value


    Optimal time complexity:
        ANSWER: O(n)
        Each value is processed once using a set for faster lookup
