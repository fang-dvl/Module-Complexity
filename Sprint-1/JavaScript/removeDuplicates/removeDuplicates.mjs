 * - Nested loop: for each element in inputSequence, it scanned uniqueItems so far.
 *   That creates quadratic behavior in the worst case.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity:O(n)
 * Optimal Time Complexity: O(n)
 *
 * @param {Array} inputSequence - Sequence to remove duplicates from
 * @returns {Array} New sequence with duplicates removed
