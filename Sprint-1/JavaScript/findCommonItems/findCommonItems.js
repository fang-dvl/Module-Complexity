/**
 * Finds common items between two arrays.
 *
 * Time Complexity:O(n * m) because for each element in firstArray, the includes method does a linear search in the second array
 *  which can take up to m steps, so that would be O(n*m)
 * 
 * Space Complexity: O(n) beacause firstArray.filter() creates an array of at most n items and Set stores at most n items, 
 * so the overall complexity would be O(n)+O(n) which we consider O(n) as they grow linerly not exponentially
 * 
 *
 * @param {Array} firstArray - First array to compare
 * @param {Array} secondArray - Second array to compare
 * @returns {Array} Array containing unique common items

// this solution is more optimised as it reduces Time Complexity. The time complexity of the inital function was quadratic O(n*m) but now it's linear O(n+m+k)
